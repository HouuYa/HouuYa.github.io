### Britain aims for global leadership role with AI safety summit

Britain will host the world's first global artificial intelligence (AI) safety summit next month, aiming to carve out a role following Brexit as an arbiter between the United States, China, and the European Union in a growing tech sector.

The Nov. 1-2 summit will focus on the existential threat some lawmakers, including Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, say AI poses. Sunak, who wants the UK to become a hub for AI safety, has said the technology could be used by criminals and terrorists to create weapons of mass destruction.
