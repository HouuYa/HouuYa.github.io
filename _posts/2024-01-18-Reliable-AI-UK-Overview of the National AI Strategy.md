### What is the National AI Strategy and why is it relevant?

Last year the government published its National AI Strategy(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-ai-strategy, Published 22 September 2021), setting the direction of travel for how the UK will retain its position as a leading AI nation over the next ten years. The National AI Strategy builds on the UK’s strengths but also represents the start of a step-change for AI in the UK, recognising the power of AI to increase resilience, productivity, growth, and innovation across the private and public sectors.

The UK is a global superpower in AI and is well placed to lead the world over the next decade as a genuine research and innovation powerhouse, a hive of global talent and a progressive regulatory and business environment. Given the rapid growth of AI and its potential to rewrite the rules of many industries and areas of life, this strategy is necessary and timely for three reasons:

  1. **To remain a top tier AI nation**, the UK needs to invest and secure access to the skilled people, data, computing resources and private capital necessary to drive research, development and commercialisation of AI.

  2. **To secure our strategic economic advantage in AI**, we must ensure that as AI comes to underwrite ever more economic activity, that the UK has both a strong domestic AI supply chain, and that businesses and individuals are supported to adapt to this new opportunity and competitive pressure.

  3. **To remain a leader as the move towards governance and regulation grows internationally**, the UK must put in place a pro-innovation governance regime, guided by the principles in the Plan for Digital Regulation(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/digital-regulation-driving-growth-and-unlocking-innovation), that protects our fundamental values at home and projects them around the world.

### Three Pillars of the National AI Strategy

The AI Strategy sets out the UK’s strategic intent to guide action over the next ten years across three pillars:

  1. **Investing in and planning for the long term needs of the AI ecosystem** to continue our leadership as a science and AI superpower;

  2. Supporting the transition to an AI-enabled economy, capturing the benefits of innovation in the UK, and **ensuring AI benefits all sectors and regions**;

  3. **Ensuring the UK gets the national and international governance of AI technologies right** to encourage innovation, investment, and protect the public and our fundamental values.

The main policy actions under each pillar are summarised in this table(https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-ai-strategy/national-ai-strategy-html-version#summary-of-key-actions).

### Delivering the National AI Strategy
Whilst the National AI Strategy offers a ten-year vision, how we deliver it will adapt to changing circumstances to ensure the most effective delivery in the wider context of the fast-moving development of AI technologies.

As we implement the National AI Strategy, we work closely with other government departments to ensure the strategy brings together the government’s ambitions for AI into a single, coherent narrative and action plan.

The National AI Strategy supports and amplifies other interconnected work of government. To find out more about other relevant policy initiatives, please visit the policy database(https://aistandardshub.org/policy-and-strategy-search/).

> ### The AI Action Plan
> 
> In July 2022, the UK government published the first AI Action Plan to show how it is delivering against the National AI Strategy vision. The Action Plan provides an overview of progress since we published the National AI Strategy, in the context of a rapidly evolving AI ecosystem within a similarly evolving global context. This Action Plan will be updated each year to show how government is:
> 
> - delivering against its vision and strategic goals to strengthen the UK’s position as an AI leader;
> - building the evidence base to better monitor and assess progress;
> - making sure the UK’s approach is future-proofed and that we are responding effectively to the latest and most impactful AI developments.
